# lab2-neural-network-from-scratch

Welcome to Lab 2 of the machine learning series.

To let you familiarize with the vectorized implementation using numpy, we have created a little task exercise 2a. Run the exercise2a_notebook in jupyter notebook environment. There you can follow instructions and implement two loss functions namely Mean Square Error and Cross Entropy. You will also learn about, when dealing with a large amount of data, how much faster the vectorized implementation is when compared with the traditional implementation using for-loop.

To run the exercise 2a, you must install Jupyter in your computer. Follow the installation instructions in our repo python-basics https://github.com/vtcstem/python-basics for reference.
